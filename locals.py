"""
Provides constants and functions used in several other modules.

The constants can be broken down into these groups:

PI
	Various multiples and fractions of math.pi

DEGREES_[direction]
	The degrees value of 8 compass directions, e.g. "DEGREES_EAST"

RADIANS_[direction]
	The radians value of 8.0 compass directions, e.g. "RADIANS_EAST"

RADIANS_[degree]
	Radian values of a circle divided by 8, e.g. "RADIANS_45"

COMPASS_[direction]
	Compass directions given a numerical constant

SIDE_[position]
	Used for identifying sides of the screen

OFFSCREEN_[position]
	Which side of the screen a player passed

Functions are provided which accept some of the above constants and return them
as values, and vice versa.
